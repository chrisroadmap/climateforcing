Climate forcing
===============

Some tools that I use in analysis of climate models.

aprp: Approximate Partial Radiative Perturbation
------------------------------------------------
Generates the components of shortwave effective radiative forcing from changes in absorption, scattering and cloud amount.

atmos: general atmospheric physics tools
----------------------------------------
humidity: Conversions for specific to relative humidity and vice versa. Currently just includes the simple formulation for humidity over water from MG Lawrence, Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 2005 (https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/BAMS-86-2-225)
